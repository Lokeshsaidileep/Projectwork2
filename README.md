## Smart Traffic Light System
This Project presents a solution to deal with traffic congestion in metropolitan cities and presents a central traffic control system which runs on a pretty simple algorithm. Our product would include the entire mechanism of detection of congestion and increasing the red light duration of traffic signals in the crossings.

## Description
A Smart Traffic Light System is an advanced traffic management system that leverages modern technologies such as AI, IoT (Internet of Things), sensors, and real-time data processing to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety. Unlike traditional traffic lights that operate on fixed timers, smart traffic lights adapt dynamically based on traffic conditions, pedestrian movement, and emergency situations.
