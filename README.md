## Smart Traffic Light System
This Project presents a solution to deal with traffic congestion in metropolitan cities and presents a central traffic control system which runs on a pretty simple algorithm. Our product would include the entire mechanism of detection of congestion and increasing the red light duration of traffic signals in the crossings.
